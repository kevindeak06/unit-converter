# Engineering Unit Converter (Python)

This is a simple command-line tool I wrote to help with common unit conversions found in manufacturing (like switching between Imperial and Metric systems).

I created this project mainly to practice:
* Python control flow (loops and if-statements).
* Handling user input safely (so the program doesn't crash if you type a letter instead of a number).

**Note:** The source code variables and the user interface are in **Hungarian**, as I designed this for local usage.

## Features
* **Length Conversion:** Inch ↔ Millimeter (mm) - Essential for reading engineering drawings.
* **Mass Conversion:** Pound (lbs) ↔ Kilogram (kg) - Useful for logistics and material handling.
* **Robustness:** Includes error handling (`try-except` blocks) to manage invalid inputs gracefully.

## How to run
You need Python 3 installed. Just run the script in your terminal:

```bash
python converter.py
